# React-Project
This is my First React-Project running on Github.
It took time for me to fix multiple errors for my properties and components to work.
Properties are attributes that define or describe an entity, object or system. The work that consist of properties(props) that I have done are also joined by the "React Hooks" assignment that I have done. React Hooks have special functions in react that allows you to use the useState method and other react features.
useState allows you to add state to a functional component and here is an example that is similar to the work that I have done using  the useState method:
 const {Count, setCount}= useState(0)
 But before using the useState I had to first import both the useState and useEffect by my component "Counter"
 useEffect allows you to run side effects, for example you can make an API call or setting up an event listener.
 After writing your code and fixing your errors as a 'Main' you have to run a couple of commands in order to push it to your GitHub as I did with the steps that I used below:
 But before you do begin with your steps to push your work to github you first need to:
 1. cd (you write the name of your project)
 2. npm start
 3. Then it will start opening your browser showing the work that you have done, then you can start pushing your work to the github using the steps below:
 You start with 
 1. git init
 2. git status
 3. git add .
 4. git commit -m ""
 5. git push
 So the most important thing that I have learnt from this project that I have done is that you can never return a component 'Twice' unless it is an array.
