# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- This is my First React-Project running on Github.
It took time and fixing multiple errors for my propertiess and components to work.
Properties are attributes that define or describe an entity, object or system. The work that consist of properties(props) that I have done are also joined by the "React Hooks" assignment that I have done. React Hooks have special functions in react that allows you to use the useState method and other react features.
useState allows you to add state to a functional component and here is an example that is similar to the work that I have done using  the useState method:
 const {Count, setCount}= useState(0)
 But before using the useState I had to first import both the useState and useEffect by my component "Counter"
 useEffect allows you to run side effects, for example you can make an API call or setting up an event listener.
 After writing your code and fixing your errors as a 'Main' you have to run a couple of commands in order to push it to your GitHub as I did with the steps that I used below:
 You start with 
 1. git init
 2. git staus
 3. git add .
 4. git commit -m ""
 5. Then everything will be pushed to your github.
 So the most important thing that I have learnt from this project that I have done is that you can never return a component 'Twice' unless it is an array. -->
